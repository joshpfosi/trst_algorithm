Algorithm Test Engine for Tufts Robotic Sailing Team navigation system

This code implements a graphical interface for comparison between an algorithm's assessment of given environmental data, and its calculated response, to a human under those same conditions. This will be used to test a long distance navigational system for a fully autonomous sail boat for the Microtransat challenge: An autonomous boat crossing the Atlantic Ocean.
